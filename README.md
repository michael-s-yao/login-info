# Storing User Login Information (Java)

This coding exercise is designed for students to practice using Arrays and List interface implementations, ```for``` and ```while``` loops, conditional statments, and abstraction and good programming practice in Java. The ```src``` directory contains the template code for the student: only ```LoginInfo.java``` needs to be modified (in addition to any new ```.java``` files created by the user). The ```sol``` directory contains example solution code.

A description of the purpose and functionality of the code can be found [here](https://michaelsyao.com/java/login-info/index.html).
